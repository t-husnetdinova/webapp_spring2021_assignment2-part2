**Names:** Tammy Husnetdinova and Alex Verkest<br>
<br>
**Class:** CSCI4800-E01 <br>
<br>
**Date:** 3/15/21 <br>
<br>
**Assignment:** 2 Part 2 for Online Social Network <br>
<br>
**Scenario:** <br>
<br>
**Learning objectives:** Our goal was to add to the progress made in the previous classwork by adding input validation and making the layout more dynamic. <br>
<br>
**Technologies used:** HTML5, CSS3, Native Javascript, Vue.js for code, Visual Studio Code for development and testing, Google Chrome browser for testing, Windows 10 OS <br>
<br>
**Justification in design choices:** We started by adding the validateForm() function following the example set in our Covid Form classwork; we check for passwords matching, existence of special characters in all inputs, and to see if the password has the required security checks (one uppercase, one lowercase, and one number). We added dynamicity to the project by intriducing Vue.js for visual infrastructure and having more interactive Security Questions on Sign Up; the formatting can definitely use an additional pass, but the work to display textboxes when the dropdown quesiton is selected does pop up as it should. <br>
<br>
**Extra features:** Nothing to document here. <br>
<br>
**Nu HTML Checker status:** COMING SOON <br>
